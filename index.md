### About Me:

I am a seasoned Senior Data Scientist specializing in retail banking in the South African context. I bring complex data to life through graph analytics and distributed data processing using Spark. With a passion for system design and a growing expertise in real-time analytics, I am constantly searching for innovative ways to add value to the business where I am employed.

### Professional Skills:

- **Graph Analytics:** Transforming complex relationships into actionable insights.
- **Distributed Data Processing (Spark):** Expertise in handling large-scale data with efficiency and speed.
- **System Design:** Architecting robust systems that stand the test of evolving data challenges, specifically focusing on AWS cloud design.
- **Real-Time Analytics:** Embracing the latest trends to deliver timely and impactful data solutions.

### Side Projects and Knowledge Sharing:

Outside the office, I am committed to expanding my skills and capabilities and writing up these projects and the knowledge gained into blogs. The projects range from learning about Linux, using agents powered by generative AI, to developing an efficient backup system for my home data. My passion for data science is fueled by each project, and also assists me in being a well-rounded and practically-minded data scientist.

Here is the running list of my blogs:
- **Personal Data Backup Project:** [*Sea* how I made my personal backup process more efficient.](blog-backup-journey.md)
